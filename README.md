##Spring 2016, Drawing on the Web Final Project

###Authors: Jessica Wang and Amanda Zeng

In our final project - inspired by April Poetry Month- we made an interactive website that
incorporates motion and poetry. The homepage is made up of miscellaneous letters randomly placed on the page. We did this using HTML Canvas/p5js. Each letter constantly vibrates in place when the mouse hovers over the letters, they move away randomly. When the user clicks on the screen the letters pause.

To navigate around the website, each page contains a header. The different tabs on the header leads the user to various poems. On the bottom right hand side of each poem page, there is a SVG of a feather pen. The SVG utilizes styled div tags for more user interactivity; when the user hovers over the SVG, it turns yellow, and when the user selects the SVG, it turns white. It also links back to the home page when clicked.

Have fun forking and modifying our project!
